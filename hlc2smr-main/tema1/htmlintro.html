    <p>Introduction to HTML: HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used for
        creating and structuring web pages. It forms the foundation of the World Wide Web, allowing browsers to
        interpret and display the content of web pages. HTML uses a set of tags and elements to define the structure,
        format, and presentation of the information contained within a webpage.</p>
    <p>HTML is a markup language because it uses tags to mark up different elements and provide instructions to the web
        browser about how those elements should be displayed. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets (<>) and come in
            pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag. The content between the opening and closing tags is affected
            by the instructions provided by the tags.</p>
    <p>Web developers use HTML to create the basic structure of a webpage by defining headings, paragraphs, lists,
        tables, forms, images, and links. HTML also allows the inclusion of multimedia elements, such as audio and
        video, and provides support for embedding other web technologies, like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling
        and JavaScript for interactivity.</p>
    <p>HTML documents are typically saved with a .html or .htm extension and can be created using a simple text editor.
        Once an HTML document is created, it can be viewed in a web browser, which interprets the HTML code and renders
        the webpage according to the specified structure and formatting.</p>
    <p>In summary, HTML is the language that enables the creation of web pages by defining their structure and content.
        It plays a crucial role in the development of websites and the presentation of information on the internet.</p>

    <p><code>
        <pre>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br/>
            &lt;html&gt;<br/>
            &lt;head&gt;<br/>
                &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;<br/>
            &lt;/head&gt;<br/>
            &lt;body&gt;<br/>
                &lt;h1&gt;My First Heading&lt;/h1&gt;<br/>
                &lt;p&gt;My first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;<br/>
            &lt;/body&gt;<br/>
        &lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>
        </code></p>
    <p>Explanation for the above example</p>
    <pre>

             The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document<br/>
             The &lt;html&gt; element is the root element of an HTML page<br/>
             The &lt;head&gt; element contains meta information about the HTML page<br/>
             The &lt;title&gt; element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser’s title bar or in the page’s tab)<br/>
             The &lt;body&gt; element defines the document’s body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.<br/>
             The &lt;h1&gt; element defines a large heading
        </pre>
    <p>
        In the above example, the elements which are enclosed by the angle brackets are known as <strong>HTML
            tags</strong>. They have
        two tags: one is the opening tag and the other one is the closing tag.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>opening tag</strong> starts with the “<” character, followed by the tag name, and ends with the “>”
            character. For example, &lt;p&gt; is the opening tag for a paragraph element.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>closing tag</strong> starts with “</” followed by the tag name, and ends with the “>” character. For
        example, &lt;/p&gt; is the closing tag for the paragraph element.
    </p>
